# attrition evaluation
Attrition is a process in which the workforce dwindles at a company, following a period in which a number of people retire or resign, and are not replaced. A reduction in staff due to attrition is often called a hiring freeze and is seen as a less disruptive way to trim the workforce and reduce payroll than layoffs.
